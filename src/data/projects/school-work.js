      <p>After sorting out the logistics of how we were going to plan and structure the project, we drew a simple wireframe for the quiz app that we then proceeded to develop into a functioning prototype of the most important parts of the app.</p>

      <p>Our philosophy while developing the app was to make sure everyone was involved with planning and execution, and making sure that everyone was following along and understanding the code we were writing. We worked both individually and in pairs while coding.</p>

      <p>I took the lead on developing some mockup designs in <b>Figma</b>, and together we decided on what designs looked best and what parts needed tweaking. After that we worked on implementing our final design with <b>HTML and CSS</b>, and finished up the project by wiping out a few bugs and prepared to present our project to our teacher and the rest of the class.</p>

      <p>As a continuation from our earlier assignment, we were given free reigns to design a portfolio page to our own liking with the implimentation of JavaScript functionality of our own chosing.</p>

      <p>I went for a simple design, and already having an idea in mind I went straight into HTML and CSS without doing a mockup in Figma first. I tried to play around a bit with transitions and explored the <b>Intersection Observer API</b>.</p>

      <p>In this project I've utilized JavaScript in the following ways:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Making the navigation menu toggleable on mobile</li>
        <li>Used Intersection observer to resize the introduction section upon scrolling down/up</li>
        <li>A horizontally scrolling marquee for displaying technologies I've worked with</li>
        <li>Fetch repositories from my GitHub to display in the "Projects" section</li>
        <li>Display a modal when clicking on a project in the "Projects" section</li>

      <p>In this project we got to familiarize ourselves with <b>Figma</b> and how to convert an existing design into <b>HTML and CSS</b>, which we'd been learning for a few weeks. I already have many years of prior experience of working with HTML and CSS, so by this point I have a good eye for structuring a design into HTML elements and a decent mental library of available CSS properties.</p>
      <p><b>Figma</b> as a tool was new for me, but it was also kind of familiar as I've worked with graphic design tools like the Adobe suite and Affinity designer, so the interface and concepts were easy to adapt to.</p>
      
      <p>I also learned more about using clever CSS-only solutions for implementing things like a dark mode switch. The method I used takes advantage of the fact that a label connected to an HTML input element acts like an extension of the input, i.e. when you click on the label it's like clicking on the input itself.</p>

      <p>"Hacky" CSS solutions like this can have drawbacks like poorer accessability for user, so although cool to play around with, a lot of the time it is better to utilize JavaScript in the real world for behavior logic like this.</p>
