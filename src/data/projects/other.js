      <p>The site was originally deployed as a static webpage and built using <b>Quasar</b> and <b>Vue.js</b> with some simple PHP server side scripting, but was later rebuilt to utilize the flat-file CMS <a href="https://getgrav.org">Grav</a> to enable for easier editing of the page content for the owner. Using <b>Twig</b> I created a custom template and ported over my previous work and adapted it into the Grav system.</p>
      <p>I'm also responsible for the design of the business logo and actively helps design product labels, folders and other graphic work.</p>
